//! This file defines a trait, `Move`, for a Pokemon move, as well as defining some structs to
//! implement the most common types of moves.
//!
//! A Pokemon move, at its most basic, has a name, base Power Point, and some effect when used in the
//! context of a `Battle`. For most moves, this is either dealing damage, boosting stats, inflicting
//! status, or changing the environment.
